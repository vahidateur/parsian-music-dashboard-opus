# PHASES — chronological ledger

One row of truth per phase. Facts below are derived from `git show --stat <sha>`, the
existing `docs/` tree and the test suite — not from recollection. Where something could not
be derived, it is marked **not recorded** rather than guessed.

> ⚠️ **Two different phase-numbering systems exist in this repository.** This ledger uses the
> session phases (Baseline → Phase 1 → Phase 2 → product phase). `docs/gap-matrix.md` uses an
> older *product* numbering (Phase 0 audit, Phase 1 auth, Phase 2 backend, Phase 3 students …)
> and is **stale** — it still lists implemented domains as NOT IMPLEMENTED. Do not conflate
> them; see [OPEN_ITEMS.md](OPEN_ITEMS.md) → documentation drift.

## Baseline — the inherited repository

**Commit:** `292b8b86ce7dd328b3a1510047f994e39c443a4e` · *chore(security): update vulnerable
build dependencies* · 2026-09-07 · author `vahidateur`.

**What it was.** The pre-existing Ava panel: a Vite + React 19 + TypeScript(strict) + Tailwind v4
single-page app, Persian/RTL, with a design system (`src/components/ds`), 13 views
(`src/views`), a demo persistence layer (`src/services/demoStore.ts`), a domain registry
(`src/domains/registry.ts`) with demo *and* API implementations for many domains, security
plumbing (`src/security`), and four architecture documents plus a production hand-off
checklist and a gap matrix.

**Why it matters now.** It is the graft boundary of this shallow clone — history before it is
not present locally. Anything claimed about earlier work must be verified on GitHub.

**Gaps inherited (still open):** fixture-driven Scheduling / Attendance / Finance / Reports
views, fabricated dashboard insight text, static sidebar badges, no backend, no code-splitting,
no browser QA. All carried into [OPEN_ITEMS.md](OPEN_ITEMS.md).

## Phase 1 — real library media, honest profile messaging, protected regressions

**Commit:** `aca40c5d6dd74ccf71513c825a3e5c6af45feb3d` · *feat(library): fix profile messaging
and real library media* · 2026-09-08 09:11 UTC · **pushed** ✅
**Size (from `git show --stat`):** 30 files, 2 905 insertions, 120 deletions.

**Purpose.** Make the library and media paths real instead of decorative, and lock the
surfaces they touch with regression tests so later phases cannot quietly break them.

**Major deliverables.**
- **A complete `library` domain**, built to the Students pattern: `src/domains/library/types.ts`,
  `repository.ts`, `demoRepository.ts`, `apiRepository.ts`, `useLibrary.ts`, `demoContent.ts`,
  wired into `src/domains/registry.ts`.
- **Real media bytes, not fake URLs.** `src/domains/media/useMedia.ts` added; media metadata
  stays in the dataset while bytes live in IndexedDB; `src/lib/download.ts` no longer produces
  fabricated download URLs; a missing blob yields an honest "unavailable" state.
- **Demo library seed material** in `src/domains/demo/librarySeed.ts` — split out as a pure
  module so provisioning in `demoContent.ts` does not create an import cycle.
- **Dataset migration** in `src/services/demoStore.ts` (+104) with `migrateDataset()`, covered
  by `src/services/__tests__/demoStoreMigration.test.ts` (+200).
- **Rewritten Library view** (`src/views/Library.tsx`, +240) and gallery cleanup
  (`src/domains/gallery/useGallery.ts`, `GalleryPanel.tsx`).
- **Three new library test suites** — `demoRepository.test.ts` (348 lines),
  `useLibrary.test.tsx` (342), `apiRepository.test.ts` (145) — plus `src/views/__tests__/Library.test.tsx` (347).
- **Two named regression suites**: `src/views/__tests__/studentProfileRegression.test.tsx` (158)
  and `src/views/__tests__/messagesDatasetRegression.test.tsx` (175).

**Validation.** Typecheck, suite and build were reported green at the time; the exact counts
are **not recorded in the repository**. What *is* verifiable today: the suites this phase added
are part of the current run, and the protected-domain regression run at Phase 2 (15 files /
166 tests) covers them and is green. `AudioMessagePlayer.tsx` predates this phase (present at
`292b8b8`).

**Remaining gaps.** The demo library file is a single seeded asset; Library is only as rich as
its seed. Learning content exists but has no level-assignment UI. All Phase 1 media guarantees
are client-side — server-side media storage, authz and virus scanning remain backend work.

## Phase 2 — explicit data lifecycle (UNINITIALIZED / EMPTY / DEMO) + empty-state audit

**Commit:** `33b10311f0d3a38745b4d0c00f22e4f63665888d` · *feat(lifecycle): make demo and empty
data environments explicit* · 2026-09-08 15:32 UTC · **pushed** ✅
**Size (from `git show --stat`):** 74 files, 2 653 insertions, 208 deletions
(= 902 lines across 62 tracked files + 1 751 lines in 12 new files).

**Purpose.** Stop the app from silently seeding demo data on read, make "whose data is this?"
an explicit persisted fact, make EMPTY a first-class environment a real customer can use, and
prove every surface renders honestly with zero records.

**Major deliverables.**
- **One lifecycle boundary**: `src/domains/demo/lifecycle.ts` (+ `src/domains/demo/useDataLifecycle.ts`
  as the only React-facing accessor). Marker key `ava:demo:lifecycle` in `src/services/demoStore.ts`.
- **First-run choice**: `src/components/lifecycle/DataLifecycleGate.tsx` mounted above
  `AuthProvider` in `src/App.tsx`, rendering `src/components/lifecycle/FirstRunChooser.tsx`
  with exactly two options (start empty / load demo). Nothing renders behind the gate while
  UNINITIALIZED.
- **No seeding on read.** `snapshot()` never writes; a corrupt or absent payload yields an
  in-memory empty dataset with zero writes and leaves stored bytes untouched.
- **EMPTY is usable**: `src/domains/demo/seed.ts` keeps all content collections at zero and the
  lifecycle layer adds exactly one bootstrap administrator so authentication can resolve.
- **Demo material isolation**: the demo library file (`res1` / `md_demo_res1`), `DemoNote` and
  demo labelling require `isDemoEnvironment()` (= demo data source **and** `demo` lifecycle
  state), never `isDemoMode()` alone.
- **Legacy adoption**: a dataset without a marker is adopted as DEMO once, preserving every
  record; Phase 1 `migrateDataset()` still runs on the same read path.
- **Empty-state computation layer**: new `src/lib/stats.ts` (`meanOf` / `ratioPct` / `topBy`
  returning explicit `null`), `NO_DATA = "—"` and nullable `faPercent` in `src/lib/format.ts`,
  and fixes in `src/views/Classes.tsx` (2 × `NaN` + 1 lying hint) and `src/views/Teachers.tsx` (1 × `NaN`).
- **Honest Settings panel**: `src/components/settings/DemoDataPanel.tsx` + `src/domains/demo/useDemoData.ts`
  no longer call a customer's data "demo", and dataset-installing buttons are hidden in EMPTY.
  No Settings lifecycle switch was added (explicitly out of scope).
- **Test harness**: `src/test/demoEnvironment.ts` (`resetToDemoEnvironment()`); 42 existing
  suites migrated to it because `reset()` no longer seeds.
- **78 new tests** in 6 files, including a full-shell walk of all 16 surfaces in EMPTY
  (`src/views/__tests__/emptyEnvironment.test.tsx`) and a panel-level audit
  (`src/domains/shared/__tests__/emptyEnvironmentPanels.test.tsx`).
- **Documentation**: `docs/architecture/demo-data.md` (121 → 315 lines), a "two independent
  axes" section in `docs/architecture/environments.md`, and a bootstrap-account section in
  `docs/architecture/auth.md`.

**Validation (measured at this checkpoint).** `npm run typecheck` clean · `npm test` 91 files /
1 255 passed / 0 failed · `npm run build` clean (~4.3 s, pre-existing >500 kB chunk warning) ·
`git diff --check` clean · Group A + Group D 314 tests green · protected domains 166 tests green.
**Browser QA: NOT VERIFIED** (no browser automation in this environment).

**Remaining gaps.** Backup envelope still labels everything "demo"; `clear()` still locks
everyone out; dashboard insights and sidebar badges are still fixtures; Scheduling / Attendance
views still do not use their real domains; Finance and Reports still have no domain layer. All
carried into [OPEN_ITEMS.md](OPEN_ITEMS.md).

## Product-feature phase — NOT STARTED

**Durable SHA:** none. **Pushed:** n/a. **Status:** ❌ not started, **not authorized**.

**Intended scope as discussed (not a commitment, no code exists):** chat/messaging UI
completion, learning-content → level assignment, removal of the remaining fake-UX surfaces,
teacher and student visual workspaces (including the unresolved student-role decision),
performance and code-splitting, research into official Telegram/Bale messaging providers, and
the deferred documentation cleanup.

**Precondition to start:** explicit authorization plus the phase spec, a clean tree, and a
re-verified green baseline (`npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `git diff --check`). Begin from
the CRITICAL/HIGH items in [OPEN_ITEMS.md](OPEN_ITEMS.md).

**Rule for whoever lands it:** add its row here with the real SHA, mark it pushed only after
`git ls-remote` confirms it, and update [PROJECT_STATE.md](PROJECT_STATE.md) §2/§3/§9 in the
same commit.
